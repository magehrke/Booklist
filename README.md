# Booklist
Booklist is a program which sorts your books. Its like a digital Library.

If you compile the program and create an executable jar, you can double click it.

Either way, executing it in Eclipse or as a jar, it will open the "Default.booklist" file, if it exists on the same level, than the program is currently situated. If no Default.booklist is defined, you have the chance to create a .booklist file in the menu.
